# Scripts for Online Training
###### Let's face it, the training is useless.

Forked from [Clutch152/scripts](https://github.com/Clutch152/scripts). This may or may not have newer versions of code.

Input these scripts into the javascript console found on most browsers. IE11 was generally required for previous training modules, but with the deprecation of Internet Explorer, Chrome and 2020 Edge [non-legacy] should be used.

> This is NOT contracted by the military, therefore, nothing defined as actual hacking will be allowed. These are, but not limited too, the following and will be denied:
- SQL Injections (To include second hand)
- Database manipulations
- Attempting to retrieve another users information
- Attempting to gain access other than your own
- Buffer overflow exploits
- Session Hijacking
- Cookie stealing
- etc...

That said, you may use/submit javascript to attempt to bypass what is needed in order to gain course completion.
Some courses also check time elapsed, so keep that in mind.
