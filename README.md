# Scripts for Online Training
###### Let's face it, the training is useless.

Forked from [Clutch152/scripts](https://github.com/Clutch152/scripts). This may or may not have newer versions of code.

**Update 6 DEC 2023**


> "The Army's primary learning management system, ALMS, is receiving a major upgrade in 2024. The new system, ATIS learning will provide users with a new, modern, and much more user-friendly interface for registering, completing, and tracking digital learning courses.

> ALMS will be going off-line at 1700 EST on January 4th, 2024 and ATIS learning will launch at 0800 EST on January 19th, 2024.

> Learners should finish any in-progress course topics in ALMS prior to 1800 EST on January 4th to ensure progress is migrated to ATIS learning. Any incomplete course topics will need to be restarted following the launch of ATIS Learning on the 19th.

> All active registrations, completions, and progress at the topic level or above will be migrated to ATIS learning."

Input these scripts into the javascript console found on most browsers. IE11 was generally required for previous training modules, but with the deprecation of Internet Explorer, Chrome and 2020 Edge [non-legacy] should be used.

> This is NOT contracted by the military, therefore, nothing defined as actual hacking will be allowed. These are, but not limited too, the following and will be denied:
- SQL Injections (To include second hand)
- Database manipulations
- Attempting to retrieve another users information
- Attempting to gain access other than your own
- Buffer overflow exploits
- Session Hijacking
- Cookie stealing
- etc...

That said, you may use/submit javascript to attempt to bypass what is needed in order to gain course completion.
Some courses also check time elapsed, so keep that in mind.
